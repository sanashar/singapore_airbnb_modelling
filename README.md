![Singapore](https://github.com/sanashar/singapore_airbnb_modelling/blob/main/heat_map.png)

# Overview 
Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Guests can search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes etc. This dataset allows us to explore how Airbnb’s are being used in the different regions of Singapore in 2019. 
# Project Goal
Hypothesis – I think that the price rage of the Airbnb’s would be somewhere between 50 to 250 and would be using regression analysis to prove my hypothesis. Through exploratory data analysis, the goal is to use the dataset to analyze and answer some questions like - Regional analysis, Price Analysis, Occupancy Analysis etc. and also prove my hypothesis.
